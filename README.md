# `spatial_led` Examples
A bunch of examples of [spatial_led](https://github.com/DavJCosby/sled) in action.

## `driver_examples`
Just showcases a few ways you can use Drivers to create cool lighting effects. When ran from the command line, will render the lighting effect to a TUI. If your terminal application doesn't support a full range of RGB colors, this visualization might not appear as expected.

## `raspberry_pi`
A trimmed down version of my personal Raspberry PI implementation. Hopefully the code will help you get an idea how you might adapt `spatial_led` into your own project!
